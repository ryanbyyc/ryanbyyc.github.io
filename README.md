# Jekyll Now

I needed a solution that I could build without installing or accessing the command line. [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo) are great tools, but I switch computers a lot. 

[Prose.io](http://prose.io) came to the rescue. Forked [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and we're up and running.
